# Kubernetes Webhooks Framework Documentation

## Intro

Kubernetes Webhooks Framework makes it simple to
implement [dynamic admission controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/)
and [conversion hooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#webhook-conversion)
for Kubernetes in Java.

## Getting Started

Before you start make sure you understand these concepts in Kubernetes, reading the docs mentioned above.

### Samples

There are samples both
for [Spring Boot](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/tree/main/samples/spring-boot)
and [Quarkus](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/kubernetes-webooks-framework/tree/main/samples/quarkus), both of them
implement the same logic. Both sync and async APIs
are showcased. This documentation describes the Quarkus version, however the Spring Boot version is almost identical.

There are two endpoints, one
for [admission controllers](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/samples/quarkus/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/sample/admission/AdmissionEndpoint.java)
(a validating and a mutating) and one for the
sample [conversion hook](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/76fd9c4b9fef6738310a7dd97b159c3668ced9f1/samples/quarkus/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/sample/conversion/ConversionEndpoint.java)
.

Starting from those endpoints, it should be trivial to understand how the underlying logic works.

### End-To-End Tests

The goal of the end-to-end tests is to test the framework in a production-like environment, but also works as an
executable documentation to guide developers how to deploy and configure the target service.

The [end-to-end tests](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/samples/quarkus/src/test/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/sample/QuarkusWebhooksE2E.java)
are using
the [same test cases](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/de2b0da7f592aa166049ef7ad65bcebf8d45e358/samples/commons/src/test/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/sample/EndToEndTestBase.java)
and are based on the samples (See Spring Boot
version [here](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/e2637a90152bebfca2983ba17268c1f7ec7e9602/samples/spring-boot/src/test/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/sample/springboot/SpringBootWebhooksE2E.java)).
To see how those tests are executed during a pull request check
the [related GitHub Action](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr.yml#L66-L66)

The samples are first built,
then [deployed](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/6959de06c0de1c8e04fc241ea5f4196219002e53/samples/quarkus/src/test/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/sample/QuarkusWebhooksE2E.java#L23-L30)
to a local Kubernetes cluster (in our case minikube is used).
For Quarkus most of the deployment artifacts is generated using extensions (works similarly for Spring Boot,
using [dekorate](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/samples/spring-boot/pom.xml#L52-L63)):

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-kubernetes</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.certmanager</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-certmanager</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Only additional resources used for admission hooks are present in
the [k8s](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/tree/main/samples/quarkus/k8s)
directory. These are the configuration files to configure the admission hooks. For example the configuration for
validation look like:

```yaml

apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: "validating.quarkus.example.com"
  annotations:
    #   Cert Manager annotation to inject CA 
    cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from: default/quarkus-sample
webhooks:
  - name: "validating.quarkus.example.com"
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [ "networking.k8s.io" ]
        apiVersions: [ "v1" ]
        operations: [ "*" ]
        resources: [ "ingresses" ]
        scope: "Namespaced"
    clientConfig:
      service:
        namespace: "default"
        name: "quarkus-sample"
        path: "/validate"
        port: 443
    admissionReviewVersions: [ "v1" ]
    sideEffects: None
    timeoutSeconds: 5
```

The conversion hook is configured within the `CustomResourceDefinition`, see
related [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#configure-customresourcedefinition-to-use-conversion-webhooks).
Since this is [not yet supported](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/4692) by the fabric8 client CRD
generator, the hook definition is
[added before](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/57a889ea1c0cb42b5a703a3cc8053f51c3982f74/samples/commons/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/sample/commons/Utils.java#L83-L110)
CRD is applied.

Note
that [cert manager](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/e2637a90152bebfca2983ba17268c1f7ec7e9602/samples/quarkus/src/test/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/sample/QuarkusWebhooksE2E.java#L19-L23)
is used to generate certificates for the application and for configurations.

## Dynamic Admission Controllers API

There are two types of admission controllers: validation and mutation. Both should be extremely simple to use.

To create the related controller simply pass a lambda to the constructor
of [AdmissionController](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/admission/AdmissionController.java#L104-L104)
that validates the resource. (See also
the [async version](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/admission/AsyncAdmissionController.java#L104-L104)
of admission controller implementation.)

```java
new AdmissionController<>((resource, oldResource, operation) -> {     
    if(resource.getMetadata().getLabels() == null || resource.getMetadata().getLabels().get(APP_NAME_LABEL_KEY) == null){
        throw new NotAllowedException("Missing label: "+APP_NAME_LABEL_KEY);
    }
});
```

respectively mutates it:

```java
new AdmissionController<>((resource,operation) -> {
    if(resource.getMetadata().getLabels() == null){
        resource.getMetadata().setLabels(new HashMap<>());
    }
    resource.getMetadata().getLabels().putIfAbsent(APP_NAME_LABEL_KEY,"mutation-test");
    return resource;
});
```

All changes made to the resource are reflected in the response created by the admission controller.

## Conversion Hooks API

[ConversionController](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/conversion/ConversionController.java) (
respectively [AsyncConversionController](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/conversion/AsyncConversionController.java))
handles conversion between different versions of custom resources
using [mappers](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/conversion/Mapper.java)
(
respectively [async mappers](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/webhook/conversion/AsyncMapper.java)).

The mapper interface is simple:

```java
public interface Mapper<R extends HasMetadata, HUB> {

  HUB toHub(R resource);

  R fromHub(HUB hub);

}
```

It handles mapping to and from a Hub. Hub is an intermediate representation in a conversion. Thus, the conversion
steps from v1 to v2 happen in the following way: v1 -> HUB -> v2. Using the provided v1 and v2 mappers implementations.
Having this approach is useful mainly in case there are more than two versions of resources on the cluster, so there is
no need for a mapper for every combination. See also related docs in
[Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/multiversion-tutorial/conversion-concepts.html).

## Using Custom Resources in the API

In order to properly register your own custom types (custom resources) for deserialization it needs to be added to
`META-INF/services/io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.KubernetesResource` file.

See in the [samples](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/admission-controller-framework/blob/main/samples/commons/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.KubernetesResource#L164-L164).

Related release note in fabric8 client:
```text
Fix #4579: the implicit registration of resource and list types that happens when using the resource(class) methods 
has been removed. This makes the behavior of the client more predictable as that was an undocumented side-effect. 
If you expect to see instances of a custom type from an untyped api call - typically KubernetesClient.load, 
KubernetesClient.resourceList, KubernetesClient.resource(InputStream|String), then you must either create a 
META-INF/services/io.fabric8.kubernetes.api.model.KubernetesResource file (see above #3923), or make calls to 
KubernetesDeserializer.registerCustomKind - however since KubernetesDeserializer is an internal class that mechanism
is not preferred.
